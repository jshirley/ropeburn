# Ropeburn

A browser extension to proactively monitor pull requests to reduce developer friction.

## In a nutshell...

Managing pull requests across a busy GitHub account can be difficult, and many
pull requests can fall through the cracks.

## Contributing

Run `npm install .` to install all the dependencies.

Install [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), and then just run `gulp`. Changes will
automatically be picked up and in `tmp/somebrowser` the extension will be
built.

For Chrome, enable Developer Mode and then click the "Load unpacked extension"
button. From there, navigate to the `tmp/chrome` directory and `select` it.
Away you go.
